# 🌫️ Real-Time AQI Forecasting Web App

### 🔗 [Live Demo](https://your-streamlit-cloud-link) &emsp;|&emsp; 🧠 Powered by LSTM & Streamlit

---

## 📌 Description
This web application forecasts Air Quality Index (AQI) for the next 15 days for any Indian city using real-time data from the **WAQI API** and a trained **LSTM deep learning model**. It provides smart **health, agriculture, transport**, and **research** advisories based on predicted AQI levels.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Real-time AQI fetching via WAQI API
- 📈 15-day AQI Forecast using LSTM model
- 🌡️ Health, Transport & Farming advisories
- 🧪 Research recommendation system
- 🖼️ Interactive charts with forecast annotation
- 🔐 Secure token handling
- ☁️ Deployable on Streamlit Cloud
